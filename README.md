This is a Test Poject for creating CBC reports using reportlab, as CBC repots are not available in country like India. 
If you want your PDF report to look more like an actual CBC repoort then you can make changes by your self.
As we know CBC reports are considered as private information and that's why it is difficult to find CBC reports data to train ML Models. This can be tackeld by generating our own data. 
So there you have it!
